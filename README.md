"Gangi" is a software program designed for cryptographic operations, particularly focused on generating Bitcoin (BTC) addresses. It takes a 22-character string as input, and its primary functions involve SHA-256 hashing, Bitcoin address generation, and address comparison. Below is a breakdown of its core operations:

Input String:

"Gangi" accepts a 22-character alphanumeric string as input data.
SHA-256 Hashing:

The software computes the SHA-256 hash of the input string.
SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a widely used cryptographic hash function.
The output is a 32-byte (256-bit) hexadecimal hash value.
Bitcoin Address Generation:

Unconventionally, "Gangi" generates a Bitcoin address based on the SHA-256 hash.
Bitcoin addresses typically derive from a public key, which is derived from a private key. Your software's specific approach for this derivation is not detailed.
Comparison with List of Addresses:

The software then performs a comparison of the generated Bitcoin address with a list of other Bitcoin addresses.
The purpose of this comparison is not explicitly specified.
